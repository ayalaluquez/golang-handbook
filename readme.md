### Introduction

The 'Go' handbook is an introductory book and is intended for beginners, the book doesn't make any assumption about your prior programming knowledge and tries to teach everything from scratch.

### Audience

This handbook is intended for beginners and new programmers, it can also be used as a reference by more experienced developers.

### Motivation

As a beginner I really struggled to find the right sources for learning 'Go' and many of the resources very not suited for new beginner or for a student who is entirely new to programming, so I decided to write a simple to understand 'beginners' book for learning 'Go'
